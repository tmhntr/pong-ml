# pong-ml üèì
A pong game with a machine learning twist!
## Description
Play the revolutionary game of pong with a friend, or against the machine.
Repo includes agents that have been trained using the openAI gym framework with reinforcement learning, as well as code to train new agents.

## Reflection:
What I learned through this project:
- Use of machine learning algorithms and frameworks for a self-directed project.
- Implementing a game using pygame.

Road map:

- [x] Add in score display
- [] Create webpage with github pages and pyjs (or alternative)
- [] Implement agents with other ml frameworks
